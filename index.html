<p>
    Have you ever wondered what our planet would be like in the future?
    What environmental problems people many generations from now would have to face?
    Even though what is yet to come will never be determined for sure,
    scientists have predicted many environmental changes in the future based on
    what is happening in the world now-and very few of them beneficial for the welfare
    of life. Perhaps the most problematic and alarming of those changes would fall
    under the category of being caused due to global warming-a highly impactful,
    hard to slow, and dangerous problem that is causing this planet to change in alarming ways.

    Science has shown that human actions, such as the burning of fossil fuels,
    land clearing, and agriculture have been the main cause of global warming for
    the past few centuries. Due to this information, it is vital that we take measures
    to slow or prevent the progression of this worldwide problem as much as possible,
    to limit the potential effects that global warming could have on our planet.
